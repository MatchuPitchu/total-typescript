// Zod is mostly written with classes. There's a base `Z.ZodType` class
// that pretty much every other class inherits from.

// Colin from Zod explains how using subclasses can
// make generics look nice in intellisense.

// Zod Documentation: https://zod.dev/
// Zd string with subclasses example: https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/blob/master/src/types.ts#L569
